Methods to check a string value that returns a True or False Boolean value:

    isalnum() -- Returns True if all characters in the string are lowercase or uppercase letters, or the numbers 0-9.
    isdigit() -- Returns True if all characters are the numbers 0-9.
    islower() -- Returns True if all cased characters are lowercase letters.
    isupper() -- Return True if all cased characters are uppercase letters.
    isspace() -- Return True if all characters are whitespace.
    startswith(x) -- Return True if the string starts with x.
    endswith(x) -- Return True if the string ends with x.

'''
'''
Methods to create new strings:

    capitalize() -- Returns a copy of the string with the first character capitalized and the rest lowercased.
    lower() -- Returns a copy of the string with all characters lowercased.
    upper() -- Returns a copy of the string with all characters uppercased.
    strip() -- Returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
    title() -- Returns a copy of the string as a title, with first letters of words capitalized.

working with files
'''
# The open() built-in function requires a single argument that specifies the path to the file. 
# Ex: open('myfile.txt')
# The file.close() method closes the file, after which no more reads or writes to the file are allowed.
# The file.read() method returns the file contents as a string.
# The file.readlines() method returns a list of strings, where the first element is the contents 
# of the first line, the second element is the contents of the second line, and so on.
# The file.write() method writes a string argument to a file.
# The write() method accepts a string argument only. Integers and floating-point values must first be 
# converted using str(), as in f.write(str(5.75))
# When writing to a file, the mode of the file must be explicitly set in the open() function call. 
# A mode indicates how a file is opened, e.g., whether or not writing to the file is allowed, if existing 
# contents of the file are overwritten or appended, etc.
'''
Mode 	Description 	                                    Allow read?     Allow write?   Create missing file?     Overwrite file?
'r' 	Open the file for reading. 	                            Yes 	         No 	           No 	                   No

'w' 	Open the file for writing.               	            No 	             Yes 	           Yes	                   Yes
        If file does not exist then the file is created.
        Contents of an existing file are overwritten.

'a' 	Open the file for appending.     	                    No 	             Yes 	           Yes 	                   No
        If file does not exist then the file is created.        
        Writes are added to end of existing file contents.


Read mode 'r' opens a file for reading. If the file is missing, then an error will occur.
Write mode 'w' opens a file for writing. If the file is missing, then a new file is created. Contents of any existing file are overwritten.
Append mode 'a' opens a file for writing. If the file is missing, then a new file is created. Writes to the file are appended to the end of an existing file's contents.
Additionally, a programmer can add a '+' character to the end of a mode, like 'r+' and 'w+' to specify an update mode. Update modes allow for both reading and writing of a file at the same time.

Such operations might include printing, accessing attributes, or how instances of that class are 
compared to each other. To customize a class, a programmer implements instance methods with special

Overloading

Class customization can redefine the functionality of built-in operators like 
<, >=, +, -, and * when used with class instances, a technique known as operator overloading. 

The below code shows overloading of the less-than (<) operator of the Time class by defining 
a method with the __lt__ special method name.

class Time:
    def __init__(self, hours, minutes):
        self.hours = hours
        self.minutes = minutes

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.hours}:{self.minutes}'

    def __lt__(self, other):
        if self.hours < other.hours:
            return True
        elif self.hours == other.hours:
            if self.minutes < other.minutes:
                return True
        return False

Rich comparison method 	Overloaded operator
---------------------------------------------
__lt__(self, other) 	less-than (<)
__le__(self, other) 	less-than or equal-to (<=)
__gt__(self, other) 	greater-than (>)
__ge__(self, other) 	greater-than or equal-to (>=)
__eq__(self, other) 	equal to (==)
__ne__(self, other) 	not-equal to (!=)

In the above program, the Time class contains a definition for the __lt__ method, 
which overloads the < operator. When the comparison t < min_time is evaluated, the __lt__ method 
is automatically called. The self parameter of __lt__ is bound to the left operand, t, and the other 
parameter is bound to the right operand, min_time. Returning True indicates that t is indeed less-than 
min_time, and returning False indicates that t equal-to or greater-than min_time. Methods like __lt__ 
above are known as rich comparison methods. The following table describes rich comparison methods 
and the corresponding relational operator that is overloaded. 

Numeric operators such as +, -, *, and / can be overloaded using class customization techniques. 
Thus, a user-defined class can be treated as a numeric type of object wherein instances 
of that class can be added together, 
multiplied, etc.

class Time24:
    def __init__(self, hours, minutes):
        self.hours = hours
        self.minutes = minutes

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.hours:02d}:{self.minutes:02d}'

    def __gt__(self, other): 
        if self.hours > other.hours: 
            return True 
        else: 
            if self.hours == other.hours: 
                if self.minutes > other.minutes: 
                    return True 
        return False

    def __sub__(self, other):
        """ Calculate absolute distance between two times """
        if self > other:
            larger = self
            smaller = other
        else:
            larger = other
            smaller = self

        hrs = larger.hours - smaller.hours
        mins = larger.minutes - smaller.minutes
        if mins < 0:
            mins += 60
            hrs -=1

        # Check if times wrap to new day
        if hrs > 12:
            hrs = 24 - (hrs + 1)
            mins = 60 - mins

        # Return new Time24 instance 
        return Time24(hrs, mins)

t1 = input('Enter time1 (hours:minutes): ')
tokens = t1.split(':')
time1 = Time24(int(tokens[0]), int(tokens[1]))

t2 = input('Enter time2 (hours:minutes): ')
tokens = t2.split(':')
time2 = Time24(int(tokens[0]), int(tokens[1]))

print('Time difference:', time1 - time2)

Output:
Enter time1 (hours:minutes): 5:00
Enter time2 (hours:minutes): 3:30
Time difference: 01:30
...
Enter time1 (hours:minutes): 22:30
Enter time2 (hours:minutes): 2:40
Time difference: 04:10


Every operator in Python can be overloaded. The table below lists some of the most common methods. 
A full list is available at the bottom of the section.

Method 	                    Description
__add__(self, other) 	    Add (+)
__sub__(self, other) 	    Subtract (-)
__mul__(self, other) 	    Multiply (*)
__truediv__(self, other) 	Divide (/)
__floordiv__(self, other) 	Floored division (//)
__mod__(self, other) 	    Modulus (%)
__pow__(self, other) 	    Exponentiation (**)
__and__(self, other) 	    "and" logical operator
__or__(self, other) 	    "or" logical operator
__abs__(self)           	Absolute value (abs())
__int__(self) 	            Convert to integer (int())
__float__(self) 	        Convert to floating point (float())

The table above lists common operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and so on.
Sometimes a class also needs to be able to handle being passed as arguments to built-in functions like
abs(), int(), float(), etc. Defining the methods like __abs__(), __int__(), and __float__() will 
automatically cause those methods to be called when an instance of that class is passed to the 
corresponding function. The methods should return an appropriate object for each method, i.e., an integer 
value for __int__() and a floating-point value for __float__().
